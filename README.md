# MySQL_Student_DB

A Student database using MySQL and python.

To run this project, you must connect it to an existing database!

Once connected (and you have changed the host, password, database, and user at the top of the file), run the command 
'python Student_MySQL_Assignment.py' in the command line in the directory it is located.

This was a project done for CPSC408 in July 2019.
